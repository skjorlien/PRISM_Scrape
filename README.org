#+title: Scraping Prism Data
#+date: [2025-09-08 Mon]

In September 2025, PRISM switched to a different FTP structure with GEOTIFFs.

I set this repo up to
1. download all precipitation, max temp and min temp at 4km daily resolution for the continental US.
2. setup a cron job to run periodically so I always have the latest daily temperature data.
3. Incorporate a couple of post-processing scripts to aggregate given a set of shapefiles.
